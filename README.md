### Goals

MediaScape targets applications that provide shared experiences across multiple devices.

This library shows two aspects of the context used in MediaScape:
  * Agent context  
The agent context provides information about the current agent, it’s capabilities and provides events (as well as sensor management) 
  * Application context  
The application context represents an execution of a multidevice application, contributed by the participating agents. It can be shared between multiple devices of a single user or multiple users, whatever is suitable for the application.  

### Structure

  * [API](API/): The JavaScript API.
  * [helloworld](helloworld/): minimal sample code.
  * [Server](Server/): The serverside code
